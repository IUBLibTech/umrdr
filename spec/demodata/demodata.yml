    - title: barren collection
      desc: A collection without works.
    - title: The Long Wind
      desc: A long winded description where the line breaks
            are replaced by spaces.  This makes typing in a
            paragraph a lot more convenient, and leaves the
            formatting up to the application. The line breaks
            don't all have to be aligned.
    - title: Collection One
      desc: Demonstration collection with multiple works.
